.. note::

    Before creating an account, make sure you are using a valid mobile number because adding a mobile number is required to create a new account on Amazon.in, while adding a location email only is optional.

You can sign in to `Your Account <https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/your-account/index.html>`_ at any time by clicking **Your Account** at the top of each page. You just need to enter the same **Mobile number** or **Email address** and **Password** to access your account.
